# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  

# Getting Started
1. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory
2. `$ npm install` - install dependencies _(optional)_
3. `$ gulp` - compile sass to css, minify js, etc. _(optional)_
4. That's it, open `index.html` on your browser by just double-clicking on the file.
